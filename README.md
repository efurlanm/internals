# Vintage computer

Vintage computer internals, or "computer archeology". The first personal computers were designed with both the operating system and programming language embedded in Read-Only Memory (ROM). This integration allowed users to power on the machine and immediately start programming without the need for additional software installation. This seamless access was crucial during the early days of computing, as it enabled users to interact directly with the hardware and develop software efficiently. The built-in programming languages, often BASIC, provided a user-friendly environment for both novice and experienced programmers, making these early computers a significant step in the democratization of computing technology.
