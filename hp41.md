# HP-41

The 1979 HP-41 series programmable calculator, which was produced until 1990, and was used in the [Space Shuttle missions](https://www.si.edu/object/calculator-hand-held-hp-41:nasm_A19890003000), has a processor called "Coconut" (or 1LE3 CPU), RAM, ROM, I/O, and uses the interpreted programming language FOCAL ("Forty One Calculator Language"). The operating system and the interpreter are stored in ROM, and were programmed using the Coconut processor assembly language also called MCODE (or "M-Code").

What catches my attention most about this calculator are the hardware expansion slots that allow you to add additional components to the system, expanding its capabilities by adding new devices, a predecessor to the expansion slots found in modern computers.

Although it lacks the processing power and versatility of modern laptops, the HP-41's design philosophy of portability and user customization influenced the development of more advanced portable computing devices.

Some user code instructions like CLX are implemented by the HP-41 in just a few MCODE instructions; other user code instructions like TAN consist of hundreds of MCODE operations.
